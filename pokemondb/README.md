Hello. 

As you can tell, this database has a lot to do with Pokemon so if you don't know what these things are, let me give you a quick 
rundown. 

~~~~~ POKEMON, MOVES, TYPE ~~~~~~

Pokemon are creatures that TRAINERS user to battle each other (basically, it's socially accepted dog-fighting. but the pokemon don't seem to be too upset so w.e)

Pokemon have a TYPE (yes, i know most pokemon have 2 types, but for the sake of time and my sanity, i've only allowed pokemon to have one type). 

The pokemon also has access to MOVES based on its type (I KNOW, I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE BUT PLS LET ME BY). 

Pokemon can sometimes have a form that they can evolve to, and a form that evolved into them. 
For example, the famous Pikachu can evolve into Raichu. But did you know that the smaller Pichu can evolve into Pikachu? Wow. Now you know. 
Pichu -> Pikachu -> Raichu 

Dont worry about egg groups. i put that in at first and then i was like nah i dont want to do this. 

Each pokemon can be found originally in a certain region. Like, you can't find an African Elephant naturally roaming in America.



~~~~~ TRAINERS ~~~~~~

Trainers have a name and a favorite type of pokemon and a favorite pokemon. 'Nuff said. 



~~~~~ GYM LEADERS ~~~~~

Some trainers can ascend into the coveted 'Gym Leader' position where trainers can come to challenge them in exchange for money, fame, power, and a small plastic(?) badge. 
Gym Leaders are leaders in towns in specific regions and each region can only have one type of gym leader. Like, there cant be 2 gyms where the leader's fav type is Fire. Only one. 



~~~~~~ REGION ~~~~~~~ 

This is basically like, a country. And like a country, each Region has one Champion. The only difference between a champion and a president is that the champion can't make any political descisions and presidents are not the best pokemon trainer in the region (at least, I think? I feel like Jefferson would have been a good pokemon trainer.)

So now what? Well now you have to make associations. 

POKEMON
  - each pokemon lives in a specific region 
  - each pokemon has a type 
  - each pokemon should know its own moves that it can use 
  - each pokemon, if it has one, should know its pre and post evolutions  
  
TYPE 
  - should know all the pokemon under it 

MOVES 
  - each move should know what type it is categorized under 

TRAINERS 
  - each trainer should know its favorite pokemon 
  - each trainer should know its preferred type 
  - each trainer should know all of the pokemon associated with its favorite type

GYMLEADER
  - each gym leader should know what region it is in 
  - as well as who it is 

REGION 
  - each region should know who its champion is. 
  


This shouldn't be too bad. 

I DONT HAVE SPECS. SORRY. JUST LIKE, USE UR COMMON SENSE TO SEE IF YOUR THINGS WORK. UR A BIG KID NOW. AND HOPEFULLY A MASTER TRAINER. IDK. GOOD LUCK.
